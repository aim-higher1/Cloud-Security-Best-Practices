## Core Security Principles

This repository is built around these fundamental AWS security principles:

1. **Implement a strong identity foundation** - Use IAM to implement least privilege
2. **Enable traceability** - Ensure visibility through logging and monitoring
3. **Apply security at all layers** - Defense in depth from network to application
4. **Automate security best practices** - Use infrastructure as code and policy as code
5. **Protect data in transit and at rest** - Use encryption everywhere
6. **Keep people away from data** - Reduce/eliminate direct access to AWS resources
7. **Prepare for security events** - Have incident response plans and runbooks
